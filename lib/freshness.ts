// Two different clocks matter and they are NOT the same thing:
//  1. Listing age — when the business record was last edited at the source (OSM).
//     Old record = the phone/site/address may have drifted.
//  2. Scan age — when WE last fetched their website and re-derived the signals.
//     Every search re-audits, so this is effectively "just now" on a fresh result,
//     but it matters once a result is exported to CSV and sat in someone's inbox.
