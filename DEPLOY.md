# Deploying LeadRadar live (for your partner to see)

Follow top to bottom. ~15 minutes. Everything here is on free tiers.

> What your partner will see once live: **Landing → Sign up → Onboarding → Custom quote →
> (placeholder) checkout → Dashboard lead search.** Real payment and verified leads come in
> the next build phases — this is the full flow demo, not yet a sellable product.

---

## Step 1 — Create the Supabase project (the database + login)

1. Go to **https://supabase.com** → sign in → **New project**.
2. Name it `leadradar`, set a strong database password (save it), pick the region closest to you.
3. Wait ~2 min for it to finish provisioning.

## Step 2 — Create the database tables

1. In the project, open **SQL Editor** (left sidebar) → **New query**.
2. Open the file `supabase/schema.sql` from this repo, copy **all** of it, paste into the editor.
3. Click **Run**. You should see "Success". This creates every table, security rule, and the
   auto-profile trigger.

## Step 3 — Grab your keys

1. Go to **Project Settings → API**.
2. Copy these three values (you'll paste them into Vercel in Step 5):
   - **Project URL** → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **anon public** key → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - **service_role** key (secret) → `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## Step 4 — Let people sign up instantly

1. Go to **Authentication → Providers → Email**.
2. Turn **OFF** "Confirm email" and **Save**. (Otherwise sign-ups wait on a confirmation email.)

## Step 5 — Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to **https://vercel.com** → sign up with your **GitHub** account.
2. Click **Add New… → Project** → **Import** the `Hassan-Naeem-code/Lead-Radar` repo.
3. Before clicking Deploy, expand **Environment Variables** and add these three
   (name → value from Step 3):
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL        = https://xxxx.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY   = eyJ....(anon key)
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY       = eyJ....(service_role key)
   ```
4. Click **Deploy**. ~2 minutes later you get a URL like `https://lead-radar.vercel.app`.

## Step 6 — Point Supabase at your live URL

1. Copy your new Vercel URL.
2. In Supabase → **Authentication → URL Configuration** → set **Site URL** to that URL and
   add it under **Redirect URLs** too → **Save**.

## Done — send the Vercel link to your partner

They can sign up, define their needs, see a real custom quote, and use the lead dashboard.

### What's still stubbed (coming next)
- **Payment**: `/checkout` is a placeholder. To take real money we add Stripe (needs a Stripe
  account + 2 keys) — tell Claude when you're ready.
- **Verified leads**: the dashboard still runs the free OpenStreetMap search with unverified
  contacts. The email/phone/active-business verification engine is the next major phase.

### Updating the live site later
Every time new code is pushed to `main` on GitHub, Vercel redeploys automatically. No extra steps.
